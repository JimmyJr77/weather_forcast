## Description
#### Motivation:
The driving force behind developing this app was to never be surprised by the rain or the scortching heat.

#### Why Build:
This app was created to provide users with an aesthetically pleasing and easy to use weather app.

#### Problem Solved:
In an age of global weather uncertainty, this arms climate activists with a chance to survive one more weathered day, potentially changing the tide in the fight against big oil.

#### What Was Learned:
On the technical side, I've solidified my understanding of core skills like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are essential for front-end development. I've gained hands-on experience with API interactions, learning how to fetch data from an external weather service and dynamically update the user interface based on that data. I've also refined my skills in date manipulation using libraries like Day.js, performed intricate DOM manipulations to refresh the UI, and delved into the principles of responsive design to make my app adaptable across various screen sizes. These technical skills have seamlessly integrated with my growing understanding of design and user experience. I've been forced to consider user-centric design elements, such as creating intuitive UI components, managing loading states, and providing effective error messaging. I've also been introduced to the finer points of crafting an engaging and intuitive user interface, complete with readable weather displays and informative icons. Overall, this project has served as a comprehensive tutorial for me in both technical development and design principles.
